- This plugin was created because of [PatarHD's](https://www.youtube.com/user/Patarhd123) 24hours coding competition. Although I had 36 hours of time for making the plugin (because of increase), I had finished it within 16 hours and 40 minutes. So if I wanted, I would have 20 hours more for coding :smile:.
